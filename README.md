# Tic Tac Toe MVP

## Overview

This repository contains a Tic Tac Toe game implemented in C# with separate projects for WPF, Console, and Testing. The primary purpose of this project is to practice the Model-View-Presenter (MVP) design pattern. The codebase was provided by Sandy Bultena.

## Structure

The repository is structured into three main projects:

1. **WPF Project:** A Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) application for a graphical user interface version of Tic Tac Toe.
2. **Console Project:** A console-based version of the game, showcasing the MVP pattern in a simpler environment.
3. **Test Project:** Unit tests covering critical functionalities of the Tic Tac Toe game, ensuring reliability and correctness.
